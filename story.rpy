    y "Hey buddy! Wake up!"
    narrator "I groan as I’m woken up from whatever wonderful dream I was having to somebody tapping me repeatedly on the shoulder. I look to my left to see a middle aged man hovering over me."
    y "Do you mind getting up for me pal? I’m trying to get to the bathroom and I don’t wanna climb over you."
    mc "Oh {w=1}…{w=1} uhhh sure."
    narrator "Just then, I hear a small ding as an announcement comes on the speaker."
    narrator "Attention everyone, this is your captain speaking. We will be making our descent shortly so, I’m going to need everyone to either return to or stay in your seats. Thank you and welcome to Sakura City!"
    narrator "I chuckle a little"
    mc "Sorry, guess not man."
    y "Damn."
    narrator "He sits down again looking defeated. I contemplate going back to sleep when the man opens the window next to his seat, blinding me with the bright light."
    narrator "I shrug it off and decide to take in the reality of my situation instead."
    mc "What the hell am I doing here?" (what_size = 10)
    narrator "I whisper this to myself but it appears the man next to me heard me speak."
    y "You talking to yourself buddy?"
    mc "I’m just trying to collect my thoughts."
    y "Long flight?"
    mc "More like a long week."
    y "I know how that feels. I think everybody’s had weeks like that."
    narrator "I nod. The conversation goes quiet for a while until the man speaks up again."
    y "So why are you traveling? Personally, I’ve come to see my family. I was supposed to be on a business trip but my daughter’s having some kinda crisis right now."
    y "Work is important but family comes first, you know?"
    mc "Yeah, I understand that. Family is important. Oh and I’m here for work actually."
    y "Work? Kid, you look way too young to have a job that requires you to travel."
    mc "Yeah, but this isn’t an ordinary job, and I’m not an ordinary worker."
    narrator "He raises his eyebrow curiously."
    y "Oh? What kind of job do you have?"
    mc "One that requires discretion."
    y "Hah! Now you’ve got me hooked. I like you kid. You seem like you’ve got a bright future ahead of you. Oh and my name’s Hayato by the way."
    mc "Player."
    narrator "We talk for a few more minutes before we finally land. I grab my two suitcases before quickly waving Hayato goodbye and exiting the plane. I get to street level and step outside to the pickup area."
    narrator "After a few mere seconds, a silver SUV pulls up in front of me. All the windows are tinted so that I can’t see inside. The window closest to me rolls down slightly and I hear a man's voice."
